# The Wild Oasis

The Wild Oasis project is a **custom-built internal application** designed for a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins. The application manages hotel operations, including **bookings, cabins, and guest check-ins as they arrive**. It relies on an **API** to handle data, which will also support future plans for a **customer-facing website** where guests can book their stays.
